*RAMP-mobility: a RAMP application for generating bottom-up stochastic electric vehicles load profiles.*

---

## Overview
RAMP-mobility is an original application of the open-source **[RAMP software engine](https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP)**, tailored to the generation of European electric vehicles mobility and charging profiles at high temporal resolution (1-min).

This repository contains the complete RAMP-Mobility model, entirely developed in Python 3.7. The model is currently released as v0.3.1. It includes a minimum 'quick-start' documentation (see below), complemented by the code being fully commented in each line to allow a complete understanding of it. 

Further details about the conceptual and mathematical model formulation of the RAMP software engine can be found in the original [RAMP](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.097) and in the specific [RAMP-mobility](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118676) publications. What is more, you are welcome to join our **[Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/RAMP-project/community)** to discuss doubts and make questions about the code!

## Quick start

Please refer to the complete **[getting started](https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP-mobility/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md)** guide for instructions on how to run RAMP-Mobility. This includes information about installation and Python dependencies, as well as a minimum walkthrough of model structure and usage.

## Model description

RAMP-mobility covers 28 European countries, namely: EU27 minus Cyprus and Malta, plus Norway, Switzerland and the UK. 
The model consists of 2 main modules:

**Module 1:** bottom-up stochastic simulation of electric vehicle mobility profiles

</p>

**Module 2:** simulation, for each electric vehicle, of a charging profile based on the previously obtained mobility pattern

Four pre-defined charging strategies are implemented, to simulate different plausible scenarios: 

1. *Uncontrolled*: The base case, where no control over the user behaviour is applied. If the charging point is available, the battery is charged immediately at the nominal power, until a user-defined value of SOC<sub>max</sub>.
2. *Perfect Foresight*: Strategy aiming at quantifying the possibility to implement a Vehicle-to-grid solution. If the charging point is available, the car is charged right before the end of the parking, at the nominal power, until the SOC satisfies the needs of the following
journey. This allows to compute the part of the vehicle's battery available to the system, without affecting the user driving range. 
3. *Night Charge*: First smart charging strategy. It aims at shifting the charging events to the night period. The car is charged only if the charging point is available and the parking happens during nighttime.
4. *RES Integration*: Second smart charging method. Has the goal of coupling the renewable power generation with the transport sector. The car is charged only if the charging point is available and the parking happens during periods when there is excess of renewable power production. As this condition is evaluated through the residual load curve, a file containing it should be provided in the folder "Input_data/Residual Load duration curve".
